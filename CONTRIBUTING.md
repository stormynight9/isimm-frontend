Before you get started, please take a moment to review these guidelines.

## Folder Naming Convention
* All folder names should be in kebab case.
* Kebab case means that words are separated by hyphens ("-").
* For example, a folder for user authentication would be named "user-authentication".

## Route URL Naming Convention
* If a route URL has two words, they should be separated by a dash ("-").
* For example, a route for user authentication would be named "/user-authentication".

## Linting
* Code contributions should not contain any linting warnings or errors.
* Please run the linting tool before submitting your code changes to ensure that they meet our standards.
